    <p>Hi, my name is Ethan and I am currently attending Algonquin college. I'm very excited to take the IMD program because I have been very passionate about video editing. I have been editing for two years and I have been apart of an amazing community along with it. There are many creative people who I have met through the community and they've inspired me to create amazing things.</p>

    <p>Other than editing, I played basketball competitively for 4 years. I used to play for my school team and the local competitive team. Basketball became a negative experience during COVID so I stopped playing for a long time. Recently, my friends encouraged me to start playing for fun again and I now play basketball every weekend when I can.</p>
